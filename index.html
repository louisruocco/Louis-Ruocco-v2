                Hi there! My name is Louis Ruocco. I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am a 23 year old graduate based in the UK. Coding, particularly Web Development is a real passion of mine and I aim to one day become a professional Full Stack Web Developer. Currently, I work as an IT Engineer for <b><a target = "_blank" href="https://expertit.co.uk/">Expert IT</a>.</b>

                I have been programming for the last 3 years. One of the only regrets in life is why I didn't start programming sooner! I really enjoy building new websites and applications and it gives me a great sense of satisfaction to see a project through to the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, I have also been able to utilise my programming skills in a freelance environment. I designed and built a landing page and subsequent website for a small legal company, based in Scotland. Being able to do freelance software development has only solidified my dream of one day becoming a web developer full time!
