            Hi there! My name is Louis Ruocco. I am a Full Stack Web Developer, based in the UK. Programming, particularly web development is a real passion of mine and I aim to one day become a professional Full Stack Developer. Currently, I work as an IT Engineer for <b><a target = "_blank" href="https://expertit.co.uk/">Expert IT</a>.</b>

            I have been programming for the last two years. One of the only regrets in life is why I didn't start programming sooner! I really enjoy building new websites and applications and it gives me a great sense of satisfaction to see a project through to the end.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started off doing front end design and I still, to this day, enjoy designing and developing websites on the front end. Then, I discovered the power of Node.js and everything changed. Being able to develop every aspect of a web application not only helps me to improve my web development skills, but it also helps me to understand the inner workings of a sometimes complex application.
